<h1>Release Notes for DNN Blog</h1>
<p>When upgrading please make sure you <strong>backup your DNN installation</strong>. Although a lot care has been taken to make sure the upgrade process is error-free, we cannot guarantee this and DNN has no provision to roll-back partial/broken installations of modules. <strong>Failure to take this precaution can leave your installation unusable.</strong></p>
